I've been thinking about you a lot,and I'm sorry I haven't texted you much lately.That's for several different reasons.For one I've been grounded for a while now,secondly I am still trying to get over you and I thought that if I cut down on texting you I would simply forget.That however is not the case.I think about you daily,and I've come to the conclusion I think I love you.You are the very embodyment of perfection. You have an extreamly high intelect that surpases my own,you are undeniably atractive,you are one of the nicest people I have met,you are very athletic,and you are better than me in every way.I'm baffeled by how perfect you are,as I've never seen it before.I envy you.From what I've heard about love I know that's what I feel for you.However since I know you have a boyfriend I don't want to get in the way of that.I would however like to get to know you a little better.I will start by giving you a little backstory..I will begin at why I was transferred to scoggins in the first place if you haven't already figured that out yet.I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at age 7.It started at a downhill slope with psychotic rage developing around 4th grade. I then was set to be transferred to a special education program SAIL at scoggins.I was put on an antipsychotic and things were going good until 7th grade.In 7th grade around fall I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder.I attempted suicide later that year by hanging myself.My parents came home and called 911. That was my first out of two attempts.I got better and that's when my love for math started. I've always had a talent with computers,but I usually wasn't too good at mathematics.I started by progressing towards algebra and then learned bits and pieces of calculus.I learned implicit differentiation,summation,series,and several other topics.I then recovered and started to get better.I started to excel at math. I got into algebra. I went into the school year happy,especially when I met you.At the begining it was a pure envy I felt for you.It then started to develope into love.That resulted in me getting depressed,for I knew I could never have someone as perfect as you.On February 14th 2015 I was plotting my second suicide attempt.I haven't told anyone about this,But I was very depressed and decided to end it all.I texted you "Goodbye" and dropped a toaster in the bathtub with me in it.Nothing happened.I started touching it,shaking it everything.I was desperate.I then got up and when I took out the toaster I was shocked for 5 seconds,and then it stopped.I then laid on the floor for 15 minutes in a fit of depression.I cleaned up.This backstory is necessary to explain why I am transfered to independence.I am transfered,because I thrived in middle school compared to elementary.However I still had the issue of depression.Independence offers excelent theorputic services.But the main reason I transfered is because of all the friends I made.I care deeply about every single one.I don't have very many,granted,but I'm close to most of them. I would really like to learn more about you,but if you don't want to share it's fine.I really do love you though,but I don't want to get in the way of anything,not that I could anyways.
